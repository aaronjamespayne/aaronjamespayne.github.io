	<p> Ben Lockwood is an assistant professor of Business Economics and Public Policy at the University of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s Wharton School. His research specializes in public economics, with a focus on issues of taxation and inequality. He has studied the use of taxes both for redistribution and as an instrument to change behavior. Recent work explores the use of work subsidies such as the Earned Income Tax Credit to accomplish redistribution while encouraging work, and the growing use of soda and sweetened beverage taxes to improve health outcomes. He has also studied the use of income taxes to encourage talented individuals to pursue professions beneficial to society. </p>
	<p> Professor Lockwood did his graduate work at Harvard University. His research has been published in the Journal of Political Economy, the Journal of Public Economics, the Journal of Monetary Economics, and the Harvard Business Review. </p>
